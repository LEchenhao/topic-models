This paper describes {\tt hca}, an open source command-line tool to
train and test topic models.  The tool implements a variety of Gibbs
samplers for non-parametric models using an efficient multicore
implementation
of hierarchical Pitman-Yor processes.  These are used for both the
document-topic component and the topic-word component, and to model
burstiness of words in topics.  Various diagnostics, document
completion testing and coherence measurements with PMI are also
supported.  The package consists of a main command-line tool
and a set of support utilities. The documentation includes a user's
guide with a mini tutorial.

\section{Introduction}
Topic models are a form of non-negative matrix factorisation
and some versions also correspond to normalised independent
(multinomial) components.
They were originally developed
as a Bayesian variant of probabilistic latent semantic analysis.
The early model, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA),
used a simple symmetric Dirichlet prior for columns of the
document-topic component and rows of the topic-word component, but
researchers soon realised non-symmetric priors could
improve modelling performance.  Using a Dirichlet process (DP) as a prior
for columns of the document-topic component was proposed by
\cite{TehJorBea2006}, and Teh distributed a relatively robust Gibbs
sampler for the task \cite{TehNBMM21}.  While this
purportedly allows the
model to ``pick'' the right number of topics, more importantly,
it allows some topics to be rarer than others.
In the simple symmetric model of LDA,
all topics are assumed equally likely {\it apriori}.

Over the subsequent decade many
research efforts have attempted to improve on Teh's algorithm,
using methods including collapsed Gibbs
samplers, approximate fitting and variational methods.
Others have developed alternative extensions to LDA.
\cite{Sato:2010} have also placed a Pitman-Yor process (PYP) as a prior
for the rows of the topic-word component.
The common prior acts like a ``background'' topic: it alleviates the need
for non-topical words (like stop words)
to be modelled by a single topic because they are
shared across all topics.
\cite{Doyle:2009} have modelled rows of the topic-word component using
a Dirichlet Compound multinomial, rather than a multinomial,
in order to introduce ``burstiness,'' whereby some words in
a document are encouraged to appear multiple times (in a ``burst'').
This tends to produce models with less topics,
and  improves perplexity.
This is implemented with a PYP, yielding a small factor overhead
in space and time over the standard collapsed Gibbs sampler.

While there are numerous other improvements made to vanilla topic
modelling,
for instance using an Indian buffet process on both
component matrices to sparsify them, from \cite{archambeau2015latent},
these above are the ones reproduced in the tool {\tt hca}:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  DPs and PYPs on both
  the document-topic component and the topic-word component,
\item
  burstiness via an additional document specific PYP on
  topic-word component, and
\item
  hyperparameter sampling
  by default using adaptive rejection sampling of
  \cite{gilks1992adaptive}.
\end{itemize}
Results using the tool were presented at KDD 2014 by
\cite{buntinemishra14}.
The implementation uses the table indicator sampling method of
\cite{chen2011sampling} which is a collapsed version of
Teh's sampler but requires just a small factor in
space and time overhead over the traditional
collapsed sampler for LDA of \cite{griffiths2004finding}.
This collapses the sizes of the tables in the classic
hierarchical Chinese restaurant samplers, leaving just the
count of the number of tables.
Most importantly, it uses no dynamic memory like the Chinese restaurant
samplers.

\section{The {\tt hca} Commandline Tool}

The {\tt hca} tool is distributed on the MPL~2.0 license
and is implemented as a Unix style command line tool
with multiple options for tasks including
specifying a variety of different non-parametric topic models,
training and testing models,
reporting diagnostics, initialising and controlling fitting of
hyperparameters, restarts and checkpointing.
These options are all documented in a standard Unix style man page with
duplicate PDF version.  Moreover, further examples of using the tool
are given at the end of the man page.

The tool itself is implemented in C.  A multicore version
can be compiled which uses threads and atomic operations available in C11
to keep data consistent. This gets, for instance, about 5 times speed-up
with 8 cores, and uses little memory duplication so can work with
quite large data sets (gigabytes of text).
In our experience, however, it does not work well with more cores like 32.
The code is self-contained, with no library dependencies.
Source code for tasks such as
adaptive rejection sampling, and Gamma variable sampling,
have been included from existing open source libraries
to eliminate dependencies.
Compilation and testing has been successful on Mac OSX and a variety of Unices,
and single-core compilation has been done under Cygwin.

While the development repository is in Github\footnote{{\tt https://github.com/wbuntine/topic-models} and {\tt https://github.com/wbuntine/libstb}},
the best way to obtain the code is via MLOSS\footnote{\tt http://www.mloss.org/software/view/527/} because this combines the two components.

\section{Using the System}

While the tool accepts many different data formats, the
most common is a format sometimes referred to as the LDA-C format.
This is a sparse matrix format where each line represents a document,
and the line contains a list of ``index:count'' pairs giving the
non-zero entries of the document by word matrix.  An example dataset
(``ch.ldac'' and its companion ``ch.tokens'' listing the words
corresponding to the indices) is included in the release.
This is composed of 400 news articles about church, ``bagged up''
as a data product from \cite{Lewis:2004}.
A typical sequence of commands is:
\begin{verbatim}
   hca -v -C200 -K40 -q6 data/ch /tmp/C1
   hca -v -v -V -r0 -C0 -orat,10 -e data/ch /tmp/C1
\end{verbatim}
The first line builds a 40-topic model with 300 Gibbs cycles
using the default configuration
for {\tt hca}, run on 6 cores in 12 seconds.
The default configuration has a DP on the document-word component,
a PYP on the topic-word component,
both with a GEM at their root, and does no burstiness modelling.
The second lines reports on the learnt model and parameters
giving the top ten words per topic.
For instance, the PYP on the topic-word
component settled on a discount of 0.31 and concentration of 209,
and the DP on the document-word component settled on a concentration of 0.8.
The three most populous topics have significant words that show the
era of the articles (1986-1987):
\begin{verbatim}
   teresa,missionaries,nirmala,calcutta,nursing,respirator
   diana,parker,bowles,camilla,charles,divorce
   appendix,crucitti,tumour,parkinson,trembling,pope
\end{verbatim}
More examples of the system, for instance document completion
testing \cite{Buntine09},
MCMC estimates of the component matrices,
and diagnostic reports of the generated 
are given in the man page.
Note several versions of document completion are implemented
in the paper as different authors use them.

\section{Related Software}

A variety of software for HDP-LDA, which places a
hierarchical DP on the document-topic component,
were compared with {\tt hca} and reported in
\cite{buntinemishra14}.
