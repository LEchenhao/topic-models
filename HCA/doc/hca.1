.SH NAME

.PP
hca
is research software 
that does various versions of non\-parametric topic models using Gibbs sampling including LDA, HDP\-LDA, NP\-LDA, all with/without burstiness modelling. Various diagnostics, ``document completion\&'' testing and coherence measurements with PMI are also supported. The code 
runs on multi\-core getting about 50% efficiency with 8 cores. 
.PP
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION

hca
reads the collection of files with stem 
\fIDataStem\fP
that form the input set of data. 
When checkpointing, or at termination, the output is written 
to files with stem \fIRepStem\fP\&.
On restart with the \fB\-r\fP\fI0\fP
option, some of these 
are also read initially to restore the previous state. 
A log of the run is reported to stderr
if the 
\fB\-e\fP
option is used. By default, the log goes to 
RepStem.log\&.
.PP
The programme is research software, so not all options 
or combinations of options work correctly. 
Note that in this release, all the more experimental features 
have been stripped, so this release contains 
only moderately well tested components. 
Note also, this is not intended to be code that others could easily 
modify. In order to get performance, to provide all the features, 
and to run multi\-core, the code is quite convoluted. 
Researchers seeking simple code they can experiment and 
modify themselves should request a cutdown version from the author. 
.PP
The programme runs a Gibbs sampler for a variety of 
non\-parametric topic models 
including HDP\-LDA. 
The model selected has three parts: 
.TP
alpha: 
this is the prior on topic vector (theta) for each document. 
LDA has a simple symmetric Dirichlet with parameter alpha 
and the vector has dimension T (the number of topics). 
.TP
beta: 
this is the prior on word vector (phi) for each topic. 
LDA has a simple symmetric Dirichlet with parameter beta 
and the vector has dimension W (the number of words). 
.TP
burst: 
this is the burstiness component which has 
a document specific variant of the word vector for 
each topic. This is not used by default. 
.PP
These parts are set using the 
\fB\-S\fP,
\fB\-A\fP
and \fB\-B\fP
options. 
.PP
There are various model parameters, notably the 
discount and concentrations for the different Pitman\-Yor 
processes in the model. 
These are usually sampled using Adaptive Rejection Sampling. 
They are also kept bounded using constraints coded 
into the util/dimdir.h
header file. 
So when a parameter fails to change, check the sampling 
by increasing verbosity and you may observe the value tries to 
change but doesn\&'t. 
.PP
The programme uses generalised second order Stirling numbers 
with the library extracted from libstb
version 1.8 
released at \fBhttps://github.com/wbuntine/libstb\fP\&.
This is initialised with predefined bounds on the tables, 
and these can be modified with the \fB\-N\fP
option. 
This should be used for collections with larger numbers of 
documents, but its best to run first and on 
error, increase the bounds. 
.PP
.SH OPTIONS

.PP
Options have a single letter followed by a possible 
single argument. Options are grouped under 
the following functions: 
\fIsetting of hyperparameters\fP,
\fIcontrolling sampling of hyperparameters\fP,
\fIgeneral control\fP,
and 
\fItesting and reports\fP
.PP
.SS SETTING UP THE MODEL AND HYPERPARAMETERS
For these, theta
is a vector for each document representing the 
topic proportions and 
phi
is a vector for each topic representing the 
word proportions. The task of the system is to estimate these. 
The vector theta and its various priors and parameters is the Alpha side 
and the vector phi and its various priors and parameters is the Beta side. 
All the scalar parameters can be set using the 
\fB\-S\fP\fIvar=value\fP
option 
and thereafter fixed using the \fB\-F\fP\fIvar\fP
option 
or by default sampled 
using adaptive rejection sampling. 
.PP
.TP
\fB\-A\fP\fIvalue\fP
 Use a symmetric Dirichlet prior on theta 
using this value
for each dimension. The value must be a positive float. 
.TP
\fB\-A\fP\fItype\fP
 A second version of the 
\fB\-A\fP
option with a string argument. 
It defines a distribution on theta and its prior mean (a vector) 
alpha
of type
as follows: 
.RS
.TP
hdp 
theta is modelled with a Dirichlet Process 
with mean alpha
and concentration b,
and alpha is modelled with a symmetric Dirichlet with concentration 
b0\&.
.TP
hpdd 
theta is modelled with a Pitman\-Yor Process 
with mean alpha,
discount a
and concentration b,
and alpha is modelled with a (truncated) GEM 
with discount a0
and concentration b0\&.
This is the default. 
.TP
pdp 
theta is modelled with a Pitman\-Yor Process 
with mean alpha,
discount a
and concentration b,
and alpha is uniform. 
This is not hierarchical because alpha is constant. 
.RE
.RS
.PP
.RE
.TP
\fB\-B\fP\fIvalue\fP
 Use a symmetric Dirichlet prior with 
this value
for each dimension. 
The value must be a positive float. 
\fIWarning:\fP
the value stored internally and printed is the total of this over the 
number of words W. 
.TP
\fB\-B\fP\fItype\fP
 Second form of the \fB\-B\fP
option. 
Use a prior beta of type
``hdp\&'' ``hpdd\&'' or ``pdp\&''\&. Similar to the \fB\-A\fP
option. 
.RS
.TP
hdp 
phi is modelled with a Dirichlet Process 
with mean beta
and concentration bw
and 
beta is modelled with a Dirichlet with concentration bw0
by default symmetric (a uniform mean) 
or its mean can be set with the \fB\-u\fP
option. 
.TP
hpdd 
phi is modelled with a Pitman\-Yor Process 
with mean beta,
discount aw
and concentration bw,
and beta is modelled with a (truncated) GEM 
and discount aw0
and concentration bw0\&.
This is the default. 
.TP
pdp 
phi is modelled with a Pitman\-Yor Process 
with mean beta,
discount aw
and concentration bw,
and beta is by default uniform, 
or it can be set with the \fB\-u\fP
option. 
This is not hierarchical because beta is constant. 
.RE

giving the lowerbound 
on probabilities. Lower ones are dropped. 
.RE
.TP
\fB\-L\fP\fIDiag,cycles,start\fP

option. 
.RE
.RS
.PP
.RE
.TP
\fB\-o\fP\fIscore\fP
 Scoring rule to pick top words for printing. 
Methods are `count\&', `idf\&', `cost\&' and `phi\&'\&. Default is `idf\&'\&. 
.TP
\fB\-O\fP
 Report log likelihood, not log perplexity. Both 
are done in base 2. 
.TP
\fB\-p\fP
 Report topic coherency in the log file, and 
save results in the parameter file. This requires 
a DataStem.pmi
or DataStem.pmi.gz
file exist 
in the right format. This can be created with the 
mkmat.pl
and 
cooc2pmi.pl
scripts in the scripts directory of the release. 
The format is a simple sparse matrix form with lines 
of the form ``N M PMI\&'' for word indices 
(offset by 0) N and M and PMI value. 
\fIWARNING:\fP
the file DataStem.pmi
needs to be specifically built for 
the dataset as the word indices must align. 
.TP
\fB\-P\fP\fIsecs\fP
 Calculate test perplexity (using document completion) 
every interval in secs
seconds. If Gibbs cycles are long, 
will report only after the cycle finishes. 
.TP
\fB\-Q\fP\fInres,file\fP

results for each. Must use the \fB\-r\fP\fIphi\fP
option with 
a pre\-estimated phi matrix (for efficiency). 
.TP
\fB\-t\fP\fIsize\fP
 Specify size of training set. It takes the 
first size
entries in the data set. Default is all the 
set minus the test data. 
.TP
\fB\-T\fP\fIfilestem\fP
 Specify a separate test set. 
Assumes the same suffix as for DataStem\&.
When using this, be sure to fix the training set size with 
\fB\-t\fP\fIsize\fP
if you do not want to train on the full 
data set. 
.TP
\fB\-T\fP\fIsize\fP
 Specify size of test set. It takes the 
size
entries immediately following the training set. 
Default is zero. This option can be confused with the above, so do not use 
filestems that are just integers. 
.TP
\fB\-V\fP
 load the dictionary from the 
DataStem.tokens
file for use in reporting. It has one token per line. 
Must have at least level two verbosity or this is ignored. 
.TP
\fB\-X\fP
 Instigate report on naive Bayes classification 
using the topic model and classes given in DataStem.class
file. 
The report is a confusion matrix to file RepStem.tbyc
built on 
the training data. 
.PP

The following files are output when the system checkpoints 
or at the end of the run. 
These are built by adding a suffix to the report stem, 
RepStem\&.

Only generated with appropriate use of the 
\fB\-l\fP\fItheta\fP
option.

topic index (offset by 0) and ``r\&'' is the burst table indicator, 
which is 1 if the word 
contributes to standard LDA statistics, and 
0 if burstiness modelling says the word is a burst 
so does not contribute to LDA statistics.

.SH EXAMPLES

.PP
.SS BASIC RUNNING
.PP
These examples work as is on late model Linux, Macs and Windows. 
However, you need to replace the executable, 
hca,
by the system dependent one, 
from the install directory where the data/
