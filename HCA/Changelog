Fixed bug with multicore when huge number of topics causing underflow of Twt (tables for
topic-word matrix).
Made -M operate off wall-time.
Added ability to have a constant alpha vector (not just symmetric) -- intended for use
on restart after akpha vector is estimated.
Extend diagostic reporting on topics.
Sorted topics on output so now most frequent first.
