The 'w' option, 08/05/14
========================
I have this basically functioning.  The idea is to build on an initial window
and then slowly move the window.   basic thing is working but now:
     * what to do with likelihood calcs?
        ->  rebuild and make them on window too!
     * how do you make it so the new stuff doesn't corrupt statistics as its
        included 
        ->  drift slowly
        ->  incorporate each doc but don't add to stats until all in ?
Currently under EXPERIMENTAL
