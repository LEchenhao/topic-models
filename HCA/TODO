The 'w' option, 08/05/14
========================
I have this basically functioning.  The idea is to build on an initial window
and then slowly move the window.   Basic thing is working but now:
     * what to do with likelihood calcs?
        ->  rebuild and make them on window too!
     * how do you make it so the new stuff doesn't corrupt statistics as its
        included 
        ->  drift slowly
        ->  incorporate each doc but don't add to stats until all in ?
Currently under EXPERIMENTAL

Need to ensure "fixed" hyperparameters remain fixed on restore!

From Allen Riddell:

3.  I'm most familiar with Mallet, so I'll use it as an example: You can save the 
  assignment of each word to topics with the --output-state option. You can then 
  divide documents by date and count the frequency of words within each topic at 
  each time step. 100M tokens should not be challenging. The R package "mallet" 
  also provides an interface for grabbing the empirical distribution over words 
  for each topic from a subset of documents.

4.  fix the description of A, B, alpha beta in the docs... these are priors
    on phi, theta etc.
