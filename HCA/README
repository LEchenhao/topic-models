OVERVIEW
========
HCA is research software that does various versions of non-parametric topic 
models using Gibbs sampling including LDA, HDP-LDA, NP-LDA, all with/without 
burstiness modelling.  Various diagnostics, ``document completion'' testing 
and coherence measurements with PMI are also supported.  The code
runs on multi-core getting about 50% efficiency with 8 cores.

The project home page and more details about the theory behind the software 
can be found at:
    https://github.com/wbuntine/topic-models/HCA/

DOCUMENTATION
=============
The documentation is in "doc/".
The man entry and the PDF file are the same.
Examples for running the code are given in the section "Examples".
There is example data files with all the different variant inputs
in the "data/" directory in the main release, that can be downloaded
separately (its largish because it has a lot of different demo files,
even though its a small collection).
Various scripts are provided "as is" with minor documention
in "scripts/" directory.

MAKING the PROGRAMME
====================
There are no prerequisites.  Although in Windows you will
need to compile with "gcc".

There is a simple Makefile in this directory currently configured
to optimise the compiler for a Linux machine.  Edit the configuration
if you have a Mac.

Then:
	#   this builds the two libraries in "lib/" and "util/" and hca
	make
	#   if it works OK do a simple test, one of
	make linux-test
	make windows-test

INSTALLATION
============
Once the softare is made, there are two files to install:
      doc/hca.1    -  the man entry
      doc/tca.1    -  the man entry
      src/hca/hca  -  the executable for non-parametric TMs
      src/tca/tca  -  the executable for non-parametric dynamic TMs
The man entry can be read using "man -l doc/hca.1", though
doc/hcaman.pdf is a better rendering of the same source file.

On Linux these can be installed locally at:
	/usr/local/man/man1
	/usr/local/bin
respectively if you manage your own machine or on your home directory at
	$PWD/man/man1
	$PWD/bin
if you have your MANPATH and PATH environment variables set up right.

The documentation in "doc/" and the test data in "data/" should
be used for reference.  The "scripts/" can be handy if you manage
to figure them out!

GETTING STARTED
===============
Work through the examples in the documentation using the data in "data/"
